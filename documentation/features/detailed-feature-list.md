## 15) Technical Notes

### Federation Best Practices
- **Clear Ownership**: Each entity has one owner, others contribute fields
- **Proper Keys**: Use `@key(fields: "id")` for all entities
- **External Fields**: Mark contributed fields as `@external` in contributing services
- **Reference Resolvers**: Implement `__resolveReference` for federated entities

### Database Strategy
- **No ORM**: Use raw SQL with `pg` for PostgreSQL to strengthen SQL skills
- **Migration Management**: Version-controlled SQL files with proper rollback support
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections across services

### Security Guidelines
- **JWT at Router**: Centralized authentication with context propagation
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all mutations and sensitive queries
- **Secret Management**: Environment variables for all secrets; never commit
- **Error Messages**: Generic client errors; detailed server-side logging

### Performance Targets
- Product listing: P95 â‰¤ 200ms
- Product detail: P95 â‰¤ 150ms  
- Add to cart: P95 â‰¤ 100ms
- Order creation: P95 â‰¤ 500ms
- Cart operations: P95 â‰¤ 150ms
